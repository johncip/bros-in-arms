      This link tag is being used to include an external stylsheet.
      You could also use a <style> tag, or inline styles, but since the styles will be the same
      on every page, doing it this way means I won't have to repeat myself.

      This meta tag is being used to say that this file uses the "utf-8" character set. [2]

      There are different ways of representing letters (etc.) as patterns of bits.
      By saying which one our file uses, we avoid the possibility that the browser will
      guess the wrong one.

      You generally want utf-8. Also, utf-8 includes emoji 😃
