There's a heavy oak door at the other end of the hallway, but your path is blocked by a pit that's the width of the room. You can't see the bottom of it. On the far side of it is a long, sturdy plank &mdash; perhaps it's a kind of makeshift moat.

You hear feet shuffling in another room. You think about jumping, but it's unlikely you'll make it, and there doesn't seem to be a way up.
