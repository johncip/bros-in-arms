You pick up the coins: a measly few groats that almost squeak as they hit your pocket.

There's not enough to bribe a guard with, and you don't expect to live long enough to spend them.

Still, they bear the beautiful face of the woman you've been sent to rescue. The king's daughter.

You're embarassed to admit that, despite being a lowly tradesman, you'd fallen in love with her royal majesty. She was instrumental in forming the resistance, and had been brave enough to risk capture.

You resolve for the thousandth time to free her, no matter the cost.
