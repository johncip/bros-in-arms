# Bros. in Arms

## A weirdly familiar HTML adventure

Bros. in Arms was written to help demonstrate a working example of [Mission Bit](https://missionbit.com)'s HTML game assignment.

### HTML Adventure Games

The idea is that you can make an adventure game using just HTML (with &lt;a&gt; tags). The game will have a set of fixed states with transitions (the links) between them.

A step-by-step tutorial on making this sort of game can be found here: https://www.instructables.com/id/Create-Your-Own-Adventure-Game-HTML/

This is a very minimal version of the fancy computer science concept of *finite state machines*. Other examples of FSMs are combination locks and elevators. They can be modeled using [state diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram).

You can do some crazy things, given enough states: https://codepen.io/jcoulterdesign/pen/NOMeEb
