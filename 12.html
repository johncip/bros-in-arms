As you turn around to find another way, two troopers rush in, and knock you out.

You wake up in a hot, sunlit room with a splitting headache. You've been fastened to a table with heavy leather straps.

"Ah, you're awake! This is the nursery, of course! We're growing a new kind of plant &mdash; and you'll never guess what they eat!"

The plant's jaws open, revealing a row of sharp teeth.
