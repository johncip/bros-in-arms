As you turn around to find another way, two troopers rush in, and knock you out.

You wake in a hot, sunlit room with a splitting headache. You try to move but realize that you've been fastened to a table with heavy leather straps.

"Where am I?" you rasp.

The reply comes from a woman in lab coat, with shiny, black, bowl-cut hair. Behind her is a plant that resembles a venus fly-trap but is many times its size.

"Morning, soldier! Or, sewer-man, is it? This is the nursery, of course!"

You struggle once more, and growl, "who are you?"

"A humble botanist, my dear. We're growing a new breed of plant &mdash; and you'll never guess what they eat!"

The plant's jaws open, revealing a row of sharp teeth. A foul acid drips between them. You begin to scream.
