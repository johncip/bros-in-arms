Before you can find a way around, two troopers rush in and knock you out.

You wake in a hot, sunlit room with a splitting headache. You're secured to a table with heavy straps.

“Where am I?” you rasp. A woman in a white lab coat replies. She has shiny, bowl-cut black hair, and behind her is a plant that looks like a huge venus fly-trap.

“Ah, you're awake! Welcome to the nursery! We're developing a new kind of plant&mdash;and this one's very hungry!”

The plant's jaws open slowly, revealing a row of sharp teeth.
