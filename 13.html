You back up, get a running start, and try to jump across the chasm.

Your heart freezes in your chest as you realize how little momentum you actually got.

One of your feet just barely scrapes the wall on the far side, but doesn't find purchase.

Somehow you manage to grip the edge of the far wall with your fingers. You feel too exhausted to pull yourself up, but remember all of the comrades counting on you, and manage to reach the top.

Two troopers run into the hallway. When they reach the pit, they turn around and run the other way.

The heavy wooden door opens with a creak, and a long staircase stands before you.
