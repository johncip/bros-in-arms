You back up, get a running start, and try to jump across the pit.

One of your feet just barely scrapes the wall on the far side, but doesn't find purchase.

Somehow you manage to grip the edge of the far wall with your fingers. By thinking of Lu, Hammer, the princess, and your other comrades, you summon the strength to pull yourself up.

Two troopers run into the hallway. When they reach the pit, they turn around and run the other way.

The heavy wooden door opens with a creak, and a long staircase stands before you.
