        <p>Once a construction worker, now a card-carrying member of the resistance.</p>
        <p>You inch slowly through a sewer pipe, dragging yourself forward on bruised and bleeding elbows.</p>
        <p>It's pitch black, and you're not sure this if is even the right way. You're tired, hungry, and you smell like poop.</p>
        <p>The urge to give up is overwhelmingâ€”your death would set the resistance back, but at least then you could rest.</p>
