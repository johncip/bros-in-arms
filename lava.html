        <p>You enter a long hallway. Its silvery stone walls are covered in murals of volcanoes spewing molten rock and orbs of fire.</p>
        <p>Something hits your head, hard. Did a trooper throw something? You scramble for cover in a daze.</p>
        <p>At your feet you see a small bronze box, and looking up, the ledge it must have fallen from. The sides of the box are covered in a strange curved rune.<p>
