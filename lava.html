        <p>You're in a long hallway. It's decorated with violent paintings: orbs of fire, mountains spewing molten rock, and the like.</p>
        <p>Something hits your head, hard. Did a trooper throw a rock? You scramble for cover in a daze. Then you see the crumbled brick, and the hole where it fell out of the wall.</p>
        <p>T did always say you were a hardheaded fool.</p>
        <p>Inside the hole you see a small bronze box, with a curved rune on the front.</p>
