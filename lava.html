You're in a long hallway. It's decorated with violent paintings: orbs of fire, mountains spewing molten rock, and the like.

Something hits your head, hard. Did a trooper throw a rock? You scramble for cover in a daze. Then you see the crumbled brick, and the hole where it fell out of the wall.

T did always say you were a hardheaded fool.

Inside the hole you see a small bronze box, with a curved rune on the front.
