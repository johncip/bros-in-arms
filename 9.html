You're in a long hallway. It's been decorated with violent paintings: orbs  of fire, mountains spewing molten rock, and the like.

Something hits your head, *hard*. Did a trooper throw a rock? You scramble for cover in a daze. Then you notice the crumbled brick at your feet, and the hole where it fell out of the wall.

T did always say you were a hardheaded fool.

There's a small bronze box inside the hole. It has a mysterious curved rune on the front.
