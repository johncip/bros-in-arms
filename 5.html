The right passageway is filled with at least an inch of wet sludge.

Having worked on the kingdom's aqueducts, you're no stranger to foul liquids. But the map is in your front pocket. Curses!

Hammer, the resistance's top spy, is like a second brother to you. He risked his life to get that map, but now it's useless.

You think to yourself that you weren't meant to be a soldier. None of you were -- your homeland had only ever known peace. That is, until those <em>monsters</em> arrived.

You see a dim speck of light in the distance.
