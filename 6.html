Hammer said that the sewer would end in the fort's basement, just a few rooms away from a hidden staircase that leads to the menace's private quarters. His escape plan, no doubt.

Even in the warm torchlight, the room's slick stone walls take on an eerie, bluish-green. You climb out of the pipe and hit the cold stone floor with a thud, cursing the unexpected drop.

Small copper coins litter the ground.

There's a passage on the opposite wall, and one to your left.
