You enter what might be a mess hall -- there's a long table with some foul meat on it.

Two troopers approach you from the side. They'd heard you coming, and waited for you to foolish come right to them.

They look almost reptilian in their green paramilitary suits.

One of holds a large mallet, wrought from black iron and polished to a shine. 

He swings it up above your head, and fiercly brings it down, before any of you can say a word.
