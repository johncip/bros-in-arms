      Below this comment is a link tag. We're using it to include an external stylesheet. We could also use a <style> tag, or inline styles, but since the style will be the same on every page, doing it this way means we don't have to repeat ourselves.

        The following section is styled with "white-space: pre-wrap", which means that unlike in the rest of the HTML document, whitespace is significant. I did this so that I could avoid using <p> tags, but usually <p> tags are what you want.

You inch slowly through a narrow sewer duct, on your stomach, your bruised elbows dragging the rest of your stocky body forward.

You can't see, and you aren't sure you're going the right way. You're bleeding, achy, hungry, and you smell like excrement.

The urge to give up suddenly becomes overwhelming&mdash;your death would hurt the resistance, but at least then you could rest.
