You climb for what feels like ages. It gets darker as you go on, and eventually you cannot see. Eventually you feel something heavy against the top of your head; you assume it to be a floor hatch.

You listen for any sound of movement above, and instead hear... snoring.

You open the hatch carefully, hoping it will not betray you by creaking. You climb the rest of the stairs and find yourself right behind your enemy. These must be his chambers; luckily, he fell asleep in his chair.

He's ugly, with a small shock of red hair on top of his huge head. His hunched back makes him look a turtle.

You sneak up behind him, pull out your knife, and put it to his throat.

"Wha? Who? Who's there?" He grumbles, half-asleep, yet to realize the danger.

"It's-a me, Mario!" you yell, and slice.
