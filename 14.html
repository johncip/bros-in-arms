You climb for what feels like ages. There's no light at the top, and soon you can't see. But finally you feel a hatch above your head.

You listen carefully and hear only... snoring.

You open the hatch carefully, hoping it doesn't creak. Climbing out, you find yourself right behind the enemy, asleep in his chair. 

He's ugly, with a small shock of red hair on top of his huge head. His hunched back makes him look a turtle.

There's a mallet in his lap, red with rust. He stirs as you take it from him.

"Wha? Who? Who's there?" he grumbles, half-awake.

"It's-a me, Mario!" you yell, and swing.
