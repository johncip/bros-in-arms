        <p>You climb in pitch black for what feels like ages. But eventually you feel a hatch above your head.</p>
        <p>You listen carefully and hear... snoring.</p>
        <p>You open the hatch carefully. Climbing out, you find yourself right behind the enemy, asleep in his chair. </p>
        <p>He's ugly, with a small shock of red hair on top of his huge head. His hunched back makes him look a turtle.</p>
        <p>There's red rusty mallet in his lap. He stirs as you take it from him. "Who's there?" he grumbles, only half-awake.</p>
        <p>"It's-a me, Mario!" you yell, and swing.</p>
