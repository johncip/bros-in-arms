        <p>You climb for what feels like ages. There's no light at the top, and soon you can't see. But finally you feel a hatch above your head.</p>
        <p>You listen carefully and hear only... snoring.</p>
        <p>You open the hatch carefully, hoping it doesn't creak. Climbing out, you find yourself right behind the enemy, asleep in his chair. </p>
        <p>He's ugly, with a small shock of red hair on top of his huge head. His hunched back makes him look a turtle.</p>
        <p>There's a mallet in his lap, red with rust. He stirs as you take it from him.</p>
        <p>"Wha? Who? Who's there?" he grumbles, half-awake.</p>
        <p>"It's-a me, Mario!" you yell, and swing.</p>
