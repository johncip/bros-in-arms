Picturing your baby brother Lou gives you the courage to crawl forward.

T had ordered him to stay above ground and help topside. But he's as stubborn as you, and likes to get his hands dirty. You know that if you don't make it back, he'll jump in right where you left off.

Your skinny brother would have an easier time getting through this duct, but you can't bear to think of him having to endure this agony.

The path continues forward, and also forks off to the right.
